1- Create a Layout component that will hold all the head info (title, meta, description) and then show the children components.

2- The layout component will be the outmost component that wraps all of the components

3- We create a component file on the components folder and the css file on the styles folder, following the patter Component.module.css 

4- @Header component we have an a tag inside of the Link tag, we don't need to do this but if you want to add a class to it you need to add the class to the a tag.

5- You can built your api using the api folder: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction
    - in the api/events/[slug].js file the code: 
    const evt = events.filter(ev => ev.slug === slug) -> this will return an array with a single event and slug, we could take it out of the array and return the object as well.

6- Fetching data: 
    getStaticProps // gets data at built time
    getServerSideProps // make request every time you go to the page
